# INR-USD-Exchange-Rate-Prediction-using-RNN-LSTM-Hybrid-Model

This project forecasts future INR closing prices against USD using historical exchange rate data (2019â€“2023).
A hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning model was trained to learn patterns in time series data.
The model predicts future values for user-defined days and visualizes the forecast.
Key steps include data preprocessing, normalization, model training, and evaluation.
